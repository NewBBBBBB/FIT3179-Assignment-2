                <p>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of a nation's <br>
                    economic output, adjusted for inflation. Unlike nominal GDP, <br>
                    Real GDP takes into account price changes, providing a more <br>
                    accurate reflection of a country's economic performance over <br>
                    time.</p>

            <div class = "subtext right">
                <p>A notable sharp decline is observed in 2020 due to the economic <br>
                    impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a gradual recovery <br>
                    in the subsequent years. The recovery seen in 2021 onwards <br>
                    highlights the resilience of the Malaysian economy as it adjusted <br>
                   to new norms.</p>

        <h2>Breakdown of GDP by Sector in Malaysia</h2>
        <div id="radical"></div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Malaysia's GDP is driven by multiple sectors, including agriculture, <br>
                construction, manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and services. Each <br>
                sector plays a significant role in shaping the country's economic landscape. <br>
                Among them, the services sector has consistently been the largest contributor to the nation's GDP.</p>

        <h2>FDI Flows into Malaysia</h2>
        <div id="waterfall"></div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Malaysia refers to the investment made by a company or individual <br>
                in one country into business interests located in another country. 
                The overall trend of FDI inflows is positive, with a significant increase from 2016 to 2023.
                However, there is a notable dip in 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Unemployment in Malaysia (2022)</h2>
        <div id="map"></div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Unemployment rate is a measure of the percentage of the labor force that is without a job 
                but is actively seeking employment. The unemployment rate serves as a key indicator of the 
                health of a country's economy.
                Sabah in Malaysia has the highest unemployment rate in 2022 among all states in Malaysia,
                meanwhile, Putrajaya has the lowest unemployment rate in 2022 among all states in Malaysia.

        <h2>Unemployment vs Poverty in Malaysia</h2>
        <div id="scatterplot"></div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Unemployment Rate represents the proportion of the labor force that is 
                without a job but actively seeking employment. 
                A higher unemployment rate suggests a weaker economy with fewer job opportunities.
                Absolute Poverty represents a household is classified as being in absolute poverty if its 
                gross monthly income falls below the Poverty Line Income (PLI), meaning the household 
                lacks sufficient income to cover basic necessities for a dignified life.
                There is a generally positive correlation between unemployment and poverty rates. This means that as 
                unemployment rates increase, poverty rates tend to increase as well.</p>
