            <p>Unemployment Rate represents the proportion of the labor force that is 
                without a job but actively seeking employment. 
                A higher unemployment rate suggests a weaker economy with fewer job opportunities.
                Absolute Poverty represents a household is classified as being in absolute poverty if its 
                gross monthly income falls below the Poverty Line Income (PLI), meaning the household 
                lacks sufficient income to cover basic necessities for a dignified life.
                There is a generally positive correlation between unemployment and poverty rates. This means that as 
                unemployment rates increase, poverty rates tend to increase as well.</p>
